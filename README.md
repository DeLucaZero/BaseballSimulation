# BaseballSimulation

Hello, this a baseball simulation I made in PHP.

The sim was made to simulate College baseball and NOT MLB.

You can view this in action on my website collegebaseballsim.com

#### Setup ####

You will need a server such as XAMP or WAMP for PHP and access to PHPMyAdmin to import the database file.

### Import Database ###

Open the DatabaseFile Folder and import gitbaseball.sql into a new database.

From PHPMyAdmin you can edit teams and players however you wish.

### Use ###

Use baseball/index.php to choose the teams to simulate.

### Issues ###

Some of this code was written years ago, so it may be a little messy or have bad documentation. If you need any help or find any issues you can contact me on discord @ DeLucaZero#2458
